# U.S. States Game ðŸ—½
`Python 3.11.1`

Test your knowledge of the names of the U.S. states, if you have not guessed them all a CSV file will be generated with the states you did not type.

### Setup
You have to install [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) to run this game:
```python
pip install pandas
```

### How it works
- Type the name of a US state and if spelled correctly the name will be placed in the corresponding state.
- If you want to end the game, just type `exit`
